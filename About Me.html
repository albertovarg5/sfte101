        <p>As a Costa Rican citizen I really recommend people to go there. For me Costa Rica has unique things like the social life and the beaches. It has been a complete nightmare coming to the US, not because thay are mean, just because is a different culture and enviroment. Costa Rica has so much things to share around the world, but I dont see many people going outside of America. Definetly my favorite experience will be my 3 best friends that I made since I was 6, and the New years parties are the best, I dont understand how people dont want to go here.The new years parties besides, is for poeple of all ages like I went last year with my friends and besides my parents were going with their friends. </p>
